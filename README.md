# Chi-Squared-in-R
This was a project I did where I used a Chi-Squared test to determine if cats would develop cancer by consuming lactose(there is no dataset to go with it as it is made in the program).

I've commented the code to show you what it does, it will create a plot of the powers at the end using ggplot2.
